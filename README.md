# Protobuf Deserializer And CLI Tool for OpenStreetMap

A lightweight command-line tool written in **C** for parsing and querying **OpenStreetMap (OSM) Protocol Buffer (PBF) files** — built entirely from scratch with **no external parsing libraries**. This project implements a protobuf deserializer that provides direct, efficient access to OSM map data in its compact binary format. The program can efficiently **deserialize** and query **any** valid PBF file.

## Why Protocol Buffers?

**OpenStreetMap (OSM)** uses **Protocol Buffers (protobuf)** as its primary data format for handling massive geographic datasets. Protocol Buffers were developed by **Google** to efficiently serialize structured data in a language-agnostic, platform-neutral format. They use a binary encoding that's both compact and fast to parse, making them ideal for OSM's massive datasets.

See the technical details of the protobuf schema followed here: https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/PBF_Format.

## Scale and Efficiency

To illustrate the scale: the map of **Andorra**, a country of just *180 square miles*, contains nearly **500 thousand nodes**.  

In human-readable XML format, this data would be approximately **~77,000 KB**, but using Protocol Buffers' binary serialization, it's compressed to just **~3,000 KB** — a **96% reduction** by efficiently encoding all the data.

This efficiency is crucial when dealing with larger regions: continents and global datasets would be impractical to work with in XML format.

## Usage

```bash
bin/osm_parser [-h] [-f filename] [-s] [-b] [-n id] [-w id] [-w id key ...]

Options:
  -h              Help: displays this help menu
  -f filename     File: read map data from the specified file
  -s              Summary: displays map summary information
  -b              Bounding box: displays map bounding box
  -n id           Node: displays information about the specified node
  -w id           Way refs: displays node references for the specified way
  -w id key ...   Way values: displays values associated with the specified way and keys
```

## In Action

```bash
bin/osm_parser -f files/andorra.osm.pbf \
        -b \                    # Get bounding box of the map
        -s \                    # Show summary statistics
        -n 625033 \            # Look up node with ID 625033
        -n 45161231 \          # Look up node with ID 45161231
        -w 5203906 \           # Get way with ID 5203906 and its tags:
        highway \              #   - highway type
        maxspeed \             #   - speed limit
        oneway \               #   - oneway status
        ref \                  #   - reference number
        surface \              #   - surface type
        -w 6165721 \           # Get way with ID 6165721 and its tags:
        highway \              #   - highway type
        junction \             #   - junction type
        ref \                  #   - reference number
        surface                #   - surface type
```

## Technical Implementation

The implementation demanded careful and precise handling of OSM’s Protocol Buffer schema, balancing efficiency, accuracy, and broad compatibility with any valid PBF file.


1. **Binary Protocol Handling**:
   - Direct parsing of varint-encoded fields and wire types
   - Multi-level nested message structures
   - String table optimization for tag management
   - Delta-encoded coordinate compression
   - Field number tracking for nested messages

2. **Data Structure Design**:
   - Custom OSM primitive implementations
   - Memory-optimized coordinate storage
   - Efficient node and way reference lookups
   - Minimal memory footprint design

The implementation strictly adheres to the OSM PBF specification, enabling reliable parsing of any valid PBF file while maintaining optimal performance and memory efficiency.
